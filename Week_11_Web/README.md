Home Work 11 - Web visualization. 

This week's homework entailed learning about HTML web design to display powerful visualizations on data analytics. 

The analysis this week was based on the information on weather data available in the data base cities.csv 

On the main webpage you'll find several visualizations and comparisons. Feel free to navigate through the different pages available. 

All of the graphs were created with the code found in the file WeatherPy.ipynb (this was week's 6 assignments. no major changes were made to the code). 

The final webpage is deployed in [Week 11's Github Page](https://maurop13.github.io/Week_11/ "Week 11 Assignment- Weather visualizations")
