Home Work Week 9 - SQL

This week we reviewd SQL databases and MySQL Workbench. 

The database used in this assignment can be found in [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).
Both output files correspond to the queries needed to get the information listed in the instructions file. To be able to run them you should have the 
Sakila database downloaded and installed in your PC.
