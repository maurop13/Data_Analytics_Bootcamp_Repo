Home Work Week 5 - MatPlotLib

During This week, we reviewed MatPlotLib and it's properties. With Pyber data (a fictional company resembling Uber), our objective was to create several plots and graphs that show interesting correlations between the data available. 

Every graph can be found both in the Jupyter notebook and in the folder named images, saved as .png images for easier viewing.
