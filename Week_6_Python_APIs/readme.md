Home Work Week 6 - Python APIs

This Week we learned how to access and Use APIs to gather information and create new datasets. 

On this assignment we created a Jupyter notebook to analyse data from Open Weather Map API. 
The final results of the analysis can be accessed in the output data folder (A csv file and a few images on the plots created). 
You can also access the scripts on the Jupyter notebook to run the code, however, note that there's a api_keys.py where you should plug in your 
OpenMapWeatherAPI key.
