# Data_Analytics_Bootcamp_Repo
Repo where all the weekly homeworks and assignments for the UC Berkeley Extension course are contained

Each week during the course, we work on a specific assignment and a new data analysis tool. Each folder will contain a instructions.md with the original instructions for each of the assignments, while each readme.md will contain an additional explanation, as needed, for each weekly assignment.
