Home Work 3 - Python Challenge. 

This was our introduction to Python. In this week's assignment we had two options to work on: PyBank and PyPoll. 

You will find folders for each of the assignment options with its final script (main.py) and the txt result for each, along with the instructions and the resources (csv files) from where the data comes from.
